Bus Management System

Welcome to the Bus Management System GitHub repository! This project aims to streamline and optimize bus services with a robust relational database backend. The complete source code and documentation for this project are provided in PDF format for easy access and understanding.

Key Components:

1) Entity-Relationship (ER) Model: The project begins with an elaborate ER model that identifies the essential entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This visual representation lays the groundwork for the subsequent steps of database design.

2) Relational Model: Building upon the ER model, we present a detailed relational model that efficiently translates the conceptual design into a set of tables. This ensures data integrity and seamless data management.

3) Normalization: To eliminate data redundancies and anomalies, we have employed normalization techniques. The normalized tables guarantee consistency throughout the application and maintain the highest data integrity standards.

4) SQL DDL and DML: The database schema and structure are defined using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL). We also utilize SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) for seamless data operations, including insertion, updating, and deletion.

5) CRUD Operations: This application provides full CRUD functionality, enabling users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete bus, route, schedule, and passenger information effortlessly.
   
7) Views, Functions, and Triggers: Our database implementation incorporates various view functions that facilitate data retrieval and database management. Additionally, triggers are used to automate specific actions based on database events.

7) JDBC Integration: To ensure efficient communication between the Java application and the relational database, we have integrated JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This integration enables smooth data retrieval, storage, and manipulation from the Java application.
